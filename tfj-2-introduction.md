Introduction
============

Generally, as the K-12 student population in the United States is becoming more diverse (National Center for Education Statistics, 2013), research has demonstrated that the mostly white, middle-class undergraduates who self-select to become teachers have struggled to effectively meet the needs of and form effective pedagogical relationships with the heterogeneous students that populate their classrooms (Causey, Thomas, & Armento, 2000; Grossman & McDonald, 2008; Lowenstein, 2009). The diversification of classrooms in terms of race, culture, national origin, language, and social class are mirrored in Indiana generally and Marion County specifically (Cavazos, 2016; Morello, 2015). Mirroring national trends, 23.1% of the the 2016 incoming IUPUI pre-teacher education majors were students of color while 76.9% were white.

Locally, the School of Education at IUPUI has deliberately made the decision to focus on the urban school context and to encourage its students to serve as educators in diverse and marginalized classrooms and schools. In its other courses, the School has focused broadly on issues of race, equity, inclusion, and social justice and is transitioning to the orientation and practices of \"Teacher Preparation 3.0.\" As the sole course in the teacher education program focusing on the uses of technology in the classroom, it is essential for EDUC W200 to align with the focus of the teacher education program at IUPUI and connect with purposes and practices that promote \"good and just teaching\" (Cochran‚ÄêSmith et al., 2009).

Addressing these demographic trends on a national scale, CAEP has identified Diversity as the other cross-cutting theme---along with Technology and Digital Media---in their standards for teacher preparation (CAEP, 2013). There have been a number of perspectives advanced in the research on teacher education to respond and meet the Diversity/Equity theme. Building upon the calls of earlier researchers and policymakers (e.g., Cochran-Smith, 2005; Grossman & McDonald, 2008; Ladson-Billings, 1995; North, 2006; Villegas, 2007), Kretchmar and Zeichner (2016) propose that it is important to transition to \"Teacher Preparation 3.0.\" Programs and courses that reflect the \"3.0\" version of teacher preparation focus on additional orientations beyond the typical pedagogical context and content of teacher preparation programs:

1\. Facilitating deep identity work so that students learn to recognize their positionality and place in a diverse cultural milieu (Jupp, Berry, & Lensmire, 2016; Lowenstein, 2009; Utt & Tochluk, 2016),

2\. Exploring the nexus of community, school, and classroom to engage teacher candidates in place-based learning in order to honor, understand, and promote and sustain the knowledge and experiences of a community (Kretchmar & Zeichner, 2016; Matsko & Hammerness, 2014), and

3\. Enculturating teacher candidates into the practices and dispositions of a community of teachers striving toward good and just teaching with technology (Au, 2002; Grossman & McDonald, 2008; Sim, 2006; Wenger, 1998).

In order for the orientations and linkages between \"teacher prep 3.0,\" \"good and just teaching,\" and educational technology to occur, an intentional redesign of the course is necessary. Underpinning this approach to the course design is the understanding that the development of the practices and dispositions necessary to effectively carry out good and just teaching can be learned: a course can provide the experiences and scaffolding to help teacher candidates develop the necessary critical consciousness for effective work in an urban school (Sleeter, Torres, & Laughlin, 2004).

While this turn towards justice, equity, and inclusion has an established base within teacher preparation as a field at large, the subfield of learning to teach with technology has not, by-and-large, been included in this turn. My colleagues and I find in a review of the literature (Price, Manlove, & Morgan, in progress) that there is little in the learning to teach with technology literature that focuses on justice-oriented purposes. This course, and the scholarship that emerges from this course revision process, will serve as a model of learning to teach with technology that allows teacher candidates to develop dispositions toward justice-oriented practices (Freire, 2005, 2006; hooks, 1994) in the context of technology.

Even as we find the United States educational system working to return to "normal," The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, in addition to the nearly 1,000,000 deaths worldwide (and over 200,000 in the US alone) as of this writing, has upended and disrupted all manner of social, economic, emotional, political, and educational activities (Bachman, 2020; Kurtz, 2020; Sorenson Impact, 2020). The pandemic has disproportionately impacted marginalized communities---those communities identified against middle-class whiteness in terms of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomics---in terms of both health indicators and educational measures (Bouie, 2020; Cerullo, 2020; Dorn et al., 2020; Horowitz, 2020).

In spring 2020 during full remote learning, engagement and achievement fell, particularly for low income students (Chetty et al., 2020), a pattern that early data indicates is repeating (Higgins & Catolico, 2020). As schools have re-opened in the US on fully face-to-face, hybrid, or fully online schedules, documented and projected lost educational opportunities have been measured in months (Goldstein, 2020), with students from Black and Latinx (Dorn et al., 2020; Kurtz, 2020) and low-income (Chetty et al., 2020; Horowitz, 2020) families and communities falling behind the most. Students with disabilities are also especially vulnerable during these uncertain times, with legally-mandated services not adequately being provided through policy or instruction (DeMatthews, 2020; Levesque, 2020). While students from these families and communities are typically underserved during "normal" times, the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified these educational gaps and inequalities (Reich et al., 2020).

The NAACP (Patterson, 2020), the Education Trust (2020), and others have pointed to improving instructional practices with technology as a way forward; we argue this is a good step but may only succeed in bringing educational inequities to "normal" levels. We further assert that orienting technology-based remote and hybrid learning through an intentional focus on Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP; Aronson & Laughter, 2016; Fraise & Brooks, 2015; Ladson-Billings, 1995, 2016) and Universal Design for Learning (UDL; Fritzgerald, 2020; Hitchcock et al., 2002; Rose & Meyer, 2000) that results in a reworking of pedagogy, practice, curriculum, and enhanced partnerships with families and communities is necessary to break through existing inequalities and provide inclusive and just learning experiences for all students during critical times of remote and hybrid learning.
